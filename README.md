# carry-look-ahead-adder

âœ¨ Why Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA)?
Ripple Carry Adders (RCA) suffer from propagation delay because each bit must wait for the previous bit's carry. CLA reduces this delay by computing carry values in advance using Generate (G) and Propagate (P) logic.

advantages:
âœ… Faster Computation â€“ Reduces carry propagation delay with parallel carry computation.
âœ… Better Scalability â€“ More efficient for large-bit additions (O(log n) delay).
âœ… High Performance â€“ Used in CPUs and ALUs for fast arithmetic operations.
âœ… Optimized for VLSI â€“ Balances speed and hardware complexity in modern processors.
âœ… Lower Power in Pipelines â€“ Reduces dynamic power in high-speed architectures.
